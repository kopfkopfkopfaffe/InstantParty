# InstantParty
*The WS2801 controller everypony can use*

InstantParty is an Arduino sketch that controls WS2801 LED strings. Hook up a few potentiometers to your Arduino and change the parameters of the lightshow on a high level as the party is rolling. Made to be used by everypony, so LJs can party too!

Build your controller from an old radio or anything with a few pots in it. Make your controller available for everyone

* Dependencies: Uses the Adafruit WS2801 Library.
